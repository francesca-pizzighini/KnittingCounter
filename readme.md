## The Project
This counter was designed and developed as the final project to complete the unit "Javascript Basics" in the Front-End Developer Master course offered by [Start2Impact University](https://www.start2impact.it).

### Prerequisite
The assignment to complete this project was pretty simple: creating an application that allow the user to decrement or increment a value on screen. 
When the user starts the page need to see a button plus to increase, a button minus to decrease and the number 0 as the value of the counter.
<br>
Additional features are welcome.

### Technical requisite
- App must be developed with JavaScript
    - The use of JQuery is not allowed
    - The use of any JavaScript framework is not allowed
    - If necessary, external Javascript libraries can be used
- The plus button, the minus button and the counter value must be implemented with javascript

## The Idea
When I started thinking about the project I decided that I didn't want it to be anonymous or unused in the future. After thinking about how I use counters in my life I decided to build something that I could find helpful in the future.

### Why knitting
In the last year I developed a huge passion on knitting and i discovered how important is keeping count (literallly) of your work. I didn't need anything complex for my work, but I couldn't find an application that truly satisfy me with the working and the design.
<br>
So I made it myself.

The first thing I needed were 2 counters, one for rows and the other for stitches.
I needed that the row counter could add or remove not only one, but 0.5 so i can count every needle done.
And I wanted a minimal but good design.

The last thing I added is the local storage: when you knit something rarely you are done in one session, so is extremely important that the website keep in memory the last action in the counter. 

### Design inspiration
Taking ispiration for design was essential for my work since I'm not very good creating new ones.
The main inspiration for me was the [application](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/counter/id478557426) I typically use on my phone.
Looking at this application made me decide to add a color changer at the top of the screen. It's a little thing but I personally love when I can personalize a little my interface, so I selected a bunch of colors for the users to pick.

Other than that I scrolled pinterest searching counters design but I couldn't find anything noteworty so I just picked some colors or elements here and there.
